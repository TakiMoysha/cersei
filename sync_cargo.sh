#
# sync_cargo.sh — publish the Cersei workspace crates to crates.io.
#
# The crate currently published is 0.1.9; the workspace has since moved on (and
# gained new crates). This script publishes every library crate at the version
# declared in the workspace `Cargo.toml`, in dependency order (leaves first), so
# crates.io always has a crate's dependencies available before the dependents are
# uploaded. Crates whose current version is already on crates.io are skipped, so
# the script is safe to re-run after a partial/failed run.
#
# Usage:
#   ./sync_cargo.sh                 # publish everything that isn't already up
#   ./sync_cargo.sh --dry-run       # run `cargo publish --dry-run` for each
#   ./sync_cargo.sh --include-cli    # also publish the `abstract` CLI binary
#   ./sync_cargo.sh --allow-dirty    # pass --allow-dirty to cargo publish
#
# Auth: set CARGO_REGISTRY_TOKEN, or run `cargo login` beforehand.
