//! The RL orchestration loop: run → (success?) → trace → plan → fan-out into
//! sandboxes → select winner → promote → register → recall via memory.
//!
//! The loop is written against the [`AgentRlRunner`] trait so it can be driven
//! by the production runner (cersei-agent + cersei-vms sandboxes) or by a mock
//! in tests. This keeps the *policy* (the loop) separate from the *mechanism*
//! (how a general agent / proposal is actually executed).
